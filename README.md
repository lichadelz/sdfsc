paperï¼š[Efficient Collision Detection Framework for Enhancing Collision-Free Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14955)

Complete code execution requires installation of [ompl](https://github.com/ompl/ompl) and [roboticstoolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python) libraries

## Start using SDF-SC:
`Time_eval.ipynb` is used to test the SDF-SC framework

`Opt_SDFSC.ipynb` tests trajectory optimization based on the SDF-SC framework

`NEO-SS.ipynb` is used to compare the reactive controllers NEO and NEO-SS
